# RoomMateFinder
A Spring MVC web appl which helps users to find room/houses 
This project will create a website that will be an online roommate finder. This website will have

two types of users: 

1. User who lists his/her room to rent out.

2. User looking for a room to rent.

In order to list a room to be rented, the user will first have to login or register with the website. 

During registration, basic user details will be recorded in the database. User then, has the 

option to create an advertisement. While creating an advertisement, user is prompted to 

answer questions about room type and any other specific preferences or concerns. This data is 

saved in the database, and will be listed out during a room search. 

Any user can search for rooms available for rent without logging into the website. An advanced 

search option will be provided, so that the user can search for rooms based on his/her own 

specific preferences, thereby making the search process much faster.
